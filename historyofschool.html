<p>University of Detroit Jesuit High School and Academy was founded in 1877 by Bishop John Baptiste Miege. It was originally located at Trowbridge Mansion on Jefferson Avenue, in 1890 the school moved across the street to Dowling Hall to accommodate a growing student body. In 1923 news began circulating that the school would move to what was then the city's edge. Then in the late 1930s construction of the new building began at 8400 S. Cambridge near Seven Mile Road, under Jesuit John P. McNichols, president of the University of Detroit. This new building was designed by Malcomson and Higginbotham. Classes at the new campus were scheduled for September 9, 1931, but a polio epidemic kept schools in the Detroit area closed until September 23.</p>

<p>As a response to financial difficulty; an Academy (7th and 8th Grades) was added to the High School in 1973 (for the 8th grade) and 1974 (for the 7th grade) to help boost enrollment and create a feeder program into the High School.</p>

<p>In the mid 1970's, many people connected to the school were advocating a relocation to the suburbs in order to stabilize enrollment, finances and resources. The potential move was also supported in light of the fact that many institutions including several Catholic high schools were moving out to suburban locations as well. However, after much prayer and an examination of the Jesuit mission for the school, the Jesuits remained committed to providing the highest quality, college prep, Catholic and Jesuit education within the city of Detroit.</p>
